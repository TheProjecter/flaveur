NOTES

This option is located in the Kernel Debugging section of menuconfig
(which is CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y in the config file)
Note: this is only available in 2.6.21 and later kernels

SUGGESTIONS
-----------

Suggestion 1: 

increase the VM dirty writeback time from 4,99 to 15 seconds with:
  echo 1500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs 
This wakes the disk up less frequenty for background VM activity

Suggestion 2: 

enable the noatime filesystem option by executing the following command:
   mount -o remount,noatime /          or by pressing the T key 
noatime disables persistent access time of file accesses, which causes lots of disk IO.

Suggestion 3: 

Enable the CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_STAT kernel configuration option.
This option allows PowerTOP to show P-state percentages 
P-states correspond to CPU frequencies.

Suggestion 4:

Enable USB autosuspend by pressing the U key or adding
usbcore.autosuspend=1 to the kernel command line in the grub config
