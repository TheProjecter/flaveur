POST-INSTALL
------------

Don't expect your programs to immediately support PAM. Usually a rebuid 
(often with special switches given to ./configure script) of the tool needed.
The first such port is 'core/shadow' one.
You may find pamized versions of most widely used tools in ci repo.

Huge thanks to Ubuntu Team for a rich-commented pam.d service files

All files in /etc/pam.d (with a minor except of 'other') were taken from 
a fresh Kubuntu installation and slightly modified to fit CRUX.
