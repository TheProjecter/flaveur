How to use?

That's not a ready-to-go application, that's maven archetype, that helps 
you create projects from scratch.

To use it, you will first need to install this archetype into your local
Maven repository.

1. Check out the sources or unpack the tarball and go to baremvc folder.
2. Install the archetype:

    mvn install

3. Enjoy!

mvn archetype:generate \

    -DarchetypeArtifactId=baremvc       \
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.0              \
